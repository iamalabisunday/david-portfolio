        <span className="blogheader">Introduction</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Hi! My name is David Okon. I am a freelance illustrator and a Graphic
          designer by profession. I have been using Clip Studio Paint in
          creating illustrations from 2018 to date for my projects and
          commissions. I am a Pro user. In this tutorial, I will be showing you
          my creative process of how I illustrated an original Mech robot.
        </p>
        <span className="blogheader">Research</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          The first thing I do is to carry out a lot of researches on the
          subject from photos and other artists works. In order, to help me
          understand how other artists interpreted the subject matter. Also,
          this gives me direction to my illustration. I, therefore, gather a lot
          of reference photos for inspiration.

        <span className="blogheader">Getting Started</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Deciding the canvas size and dpi depends on your choice of preference.
          In this illustration, I will be using an A4 Canvas size and 400 dpi in
          Portrait format, which is my choice and preference.
        </p>

        <span className="blogheader">Sketch</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Sketching is a fun process. I always see it as the basic foundation of
          every illustration. The first thing I do while sketching is to
          establish the pose. After that, I work on the body shape and size as a
          whole. I am a fan of using the default “Lighter pencil”. But in this
          tutorial, I will be using the default “Design Pencil” for sketching.
        </p>
        <p className="blogbody">
          While sketching sometimes, I am a huge fan of flipping Navigator to
          spot out a mistake. I believe it is a good practice to see the image
          in a new form.

        <span className="blogheader">Blocking in Colours</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          I begin to block the silhouette in colour using a Turnip pen. I
          sometimes increase the (stabilization settings from 2 to 62 in Turnip
          brush settings) to avoid shaky hands for the edges.
        </p>
        <p className="blogbody">
          I then created the layer above and clipped it. In this new layer, I
          start blocking the form using the default Gouache brush. To give me an
          idea of how the colour scheme will likely look in the final
          illustration. I sometimes make changes to the colour scheme if I don’t
          like it.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog/blocking.png" alt="Blocking" />
        <span className="blogheader">Refining the forms</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Refining forms of the main subject is quite challenging, but not to
          worry, there are ways we can do that. The stabilization feature in the
          Clip Studio Paintbrush engine is a lifesaver. In the Gouache brush
          setting by default, the stabilization is not visible in the brush sub
          tool. What we will do is to bring it out from the sub toolset.
        </p>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Now With my sketch layer visible. I set the transparency to about 68%
          with this both draft and my painting are visible. I then set up the
          stabilization in the Gouache brush from (60 -100) and redraw out the
          main lines.

        <span className="blogheader">Adding Details</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          I added details using the Gouache brush and blending with the Gouache
          blender.

        <span className="blogheader">Adding Atmosphere</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          I created a layer above the mech robot and used the default Running
          Colour edge brush. (from Watercolour brush set) and a Soft airbrush to
          draw shapes of smoke covering some part of his feet.

        <span className="blogheader">Colour Adjustments</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          At some point in an illustration, you can sometimes feel unhappy with
          the colours. Then no need to worry the Tonal correction is there to
          bail you out. At this level of the illustration, I am not happy with
          the value and colour of the main subject. I decided to use the Tonal
          curves to increase the colour vividity and increase the Saturation.
        </p>

        <img src="/blog/huesaturation.png" alt="Tone Curve" className="w-fit" />
        <span className="blogheader">Additional Light</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          It is always nice to balance your painting. In this case, I added two
          light sources, both warm and cool colours, which gives this
          illustration a balanced look.
        </p>

        <span className="blogheader">Finishing Up</span>
        <p className="blogbody">
          Two things I take into consideration at the finishing stage are edge
          control and Depth of focus. At this stage, a blur tool is a great
          tool. I set the intensity blur to 0.5. I apply light pressure to blend
          the edges and blur parts that are out of focus.
        </p>
        <p className="blogbody">
          In this case, the legs, the left shoulder and others that are in
          distance are blurred.
        </p>
        <img src="/blog/finishingcanva.png" alt="Finishing Canva" />
        <p className="blogbody">
          I always check my value in greyscale, as this is necessary to check if
          your image is readable.
        </p>

          So we are done. I hope you learnt a lot. Here is the finished
          illustration.
